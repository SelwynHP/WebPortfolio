            <h1>My Birth Place</h1>

                <p>
                    I was born in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Baoding" target="_blank">Baoding city, Hebei province</a>, China. Mongolia is in the north of China, and Thailand is in the south. 
                    There are 1.42 billion people in China. In China, Mandarin is the main language, the second language is Cantonese or English. 
                    There are many tourist attractions. For example, there is the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square, Mount Tai, and the Hukou Waterfall on the Yellow River. 
                    It's amazing and beautiful.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Baoding city is next to the capital city, Beijing. It takes approximately 2 hours on highway from Baoding to Beijing. Baoding is 200km away from Beijing. There are more than 1.1 million people in Baoding city. 
                    There are not many tourist attractions. But, there are some special places. For example, there is Jingxiu Park, Wanhao Golf Training Ground, and Yesanpo National Park. 
                    They are unique and very beautiful. I love the food of my city and I love people living in my city, but I do not like air pollution and traffic jams.
