Hello Sir,

Here is the instruction of my project, the webpage starts with "WelcomePage.html", then you will see my selfie, then click the photo to get access to my main page. OR you can click "Request CV" to view my CV. The logo on each main page is clickable, and it will bring you back to welcome page.

The menu list on the "TimelinePage.html" is invisible, please move your mouse on the top to see the menu list.

I only use the "media" in "TimelineStyle.css" and "ContactStyle.css".

I only use "javascript" in "HomePage.html" and "TimelinePage.html" and "ContactPage.html".

Thank you,

Zhibo
